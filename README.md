# Assignment

## React and API Assignment for Software Dev Internship Role

This assignment is designed to help us understand your technical skills.

## Some Points and Tips:
1. **Language/Components**: Feel free to use whichever language or components you prefer.
2. **Preference**: React (in TypeScript) is preferred because we use it.
3. **UI Library**: Check out [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) for components but feel free to use whichever library you’re comfortable with.
4. **Creativity**: There are no hard rules, so be creative with these tasks.

## Task 2: Analytics

### Data Information:
- You’ll be working with the dataset [here](#).
- The dataset provides information on ML Engineer salaries from 2020 to 2024.
- You can either create an API to fetch this data or just include this data in a file within your frontend codebase.

### Description:
Based on this data, create a table (call it “main table”) with the following columns:
1. **Year**
2. **Number of total jobs for that year**
3. **Average salary in USD**

Users should be able to sort the table by any column.

## Extended Task: Analytics

Our users want to further understand this data. Using the same data, create the following:

1. **Line Graph**: Display how the number of total jobs has changed from 2020 to 2024 (the Kaggle link provides a similar bar graph).
2. **Detailed View**: When a user clicks a row from the main table, a second table should appear displaying aggregated job titles and the number of jobs for that year. For example, if the user clicks on 2022, all the titles from 2022 should appear in another table, along with the count of how many times each job title appeared in 2022.

## Bonus Task: Using LLMs

Now let’s say our users want to find insights from the data beyond the graphs. This was not possible before LLMs, but today it is.

### Description:
Create a chat app that provides the best response based on business knowledge derived from the data. There’s a tutorial attached that shows how to do this for sales emails; your task is to apply it to the Kaggle data.

### Reference:
Here’s a tutorial that shows how this can be achieved: [YouTube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_nCjlSB1Zk)
